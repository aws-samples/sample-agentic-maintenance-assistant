# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/). Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue.

## Security Best Practices

This sample demonstrates security best practices including:

- **Authentication**: Uses Amazon Cognito for secure authentication
- **Authorization**: Implements proper IAM roles and policies with least privilege
- **API Security**: Implements proper API authentication with Bearer tokens for interaction with 3rd party applications

## Secure Configuration

When deploying this solution:

1. **Review IAM Policies**: Ensure all IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
2. **Update Credentials**: Never commit AWS credentials or API keys to version control
3. **Environment Variables**: Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
4. **Network Access**: Restrict network access using security groups and NACLs
5. **Monitoring**: Enable AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch for security monitoring

## Dependencies

This project uses various dependencies. Please ensure you:

- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions
- Review security advisories for all dependencies
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities

## Data Privacy

This sample processes maintenance data and sensor information. When using in production:

- Implement proper data classification and handling procedures
- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations
- Use encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data retention and deletion policies
